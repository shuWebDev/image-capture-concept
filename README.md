# image-capture-concept
basic idea of capturing an image from a webcam, if possible


open the HTML file in a browser. Browser should ask for permission to use the camera. Buttons to start the camera, take a snapshot for display and stop the camera.
As far as what to do with the captured image once captured, that's TBD.
